## My dotfiles

### CAUTION ###

1. This is my dotfiles, I know how to use it, if you don't know then don't use it!
2. Some of those aliases and functions are for OS X
3. I'm not responsilbe for any damage/benefit you get from any of these scripts
4. If you want to use it, please read it first, if you can't read shell scripts and vice versa, then please **DON't USE IT**

### How to use

1. Create a sylimk for bin directory in your home directory, and add it to your path
2. For every file in config directory, create a symlink with name of `.$FILE` in your home directory
3. For plugins fetch submodules (if you don't know how just google it, you're lazy? Here's a SO [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1030169/easy-way-pull-latest-of-all-submodules))
